I would like to felicitate the whole Islamic Ummah, the great Iranian nation and you the venerable audience, especially the esteemed guests from other Islamic countries and the ambassadors of Islamic states who have attended this gathering, on the birth anniversary of the savior of mankind and the divine gift bestowed on humanity, Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him and his infallible household), and the birth anniversary of Imam Ja'far Sadeq (greetings be upon him).
The birth of the last messenger of Allah marked the dawn of divine grace and blessings on humanity. The holy Qur'an describes the Prophet as "mercy for all mankind". (21:107)
This mercy and blessing is comprehensive, as it affects upbringing and education, purification of the soul and guidance of mankind toward the right path. In other words, it affects both spiritual and material aspects of life. Besides, it is neither limited to any certain time and era nor confined to any particular nation. "And others from among them who have not yet joined them; and He is the Mighty, the Wise." (62:3) 
Unfortunately, following the first few centuries in Islamic era, Muslim Ummah was faced with certain challenges, deviations and even internal conflicts. Muslims were also tormented by tyrannical rulers.
Consequently, in the course of those centuries, Muslim nations could not accomplish the objectives that had been delineated by Islam and the holy Prophet, despite all the wealth and natural resources that they possessed, and they lagged behind other nations in science and technology.
