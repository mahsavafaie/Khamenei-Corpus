 As usual, you are among the first to cast your ballot. The Iranian nation is ready to hear your advice and recommendations regarding the importance of this round of the election and the people's role in it. 
 In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
The importance of this round of the election is the same as the previous round. In terms of its importance, the second round of the election is no different from the first round. The same sentiments and the same sense of responsibility that caused us to go to polling stations are calling on us now to go to the ballot boxes and cast our votes. There is an old Persian adage in this regard that is well known: "'Who did the job?' 'The one who finished it.'" 
By Allah's Favor, our esteemed nation will go to polling stations in constituencies where the election has gone into the second round so that a good number of ballots are collected and, by Allah's grace, a good parliament is formed.
 Thank you very much indeed.
 Thank you.
May Allah accept these efforts from all of you and bestow success on you. I hope that you will find many more opportunities to do this responsibility.[1]
