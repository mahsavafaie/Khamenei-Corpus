I am thankful to the Almighty for giving me the opportunity to visit this city and meet its honorable residents.
The inhabitants of Varamin, Pishva, Qarchak, Javadabad and Pakdasht have a very brilliant revolutionary record, in addition to having strong faith and resolution and deep religious beliefs. In fact, on June 5, 1963, the people of this region made it clear that in order to protect their religion and their noble values, they were ready to have their blood shed at the hands of the cruel agents of the former regime. Today, those unknown martyrs are shining luminaries in the sky of the Islamic Iran.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution and with the outbreak of the Iraqi imposed war, the people of this region made great sacrifices in defending our country against foreign aggression. There are many families here whose two or three or even four children were martyred in the course of the sacred defense. It is also worthy of mention that some 32 high-ranking officers of the armed forces who achieved martyrdom during the imposed war were from this region.
Some are trying to strip our devoted and honorable people of their past glories. What invigorates a nation is its past honor and achievements. But one should never rest on one's laurels. Instead, one's past glories should motivate one to make greater strides. This is what the Iranian people did and, as a result, they managed to bring about the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of our Islamic system.
I once again express my gratitude to you, the esteemed inhabitants of Varamin and its districts like Pishva, Gharchak, Bagherabad and Javadabad and the honorable residents of Pakdasht, for your sincerity, perseverance and deep religious faith. I am very happy that Almighty Allah gave me this opportunity to meet you today. 
Greetings be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings
